% Command to include graphic pdf corresponding to #1.{tikz,dcg,tex}
% Special handling is necessary, in order to convince latexmk that the initially missing #2.pdf is not a hard error but
% actually rather an expected one. Without that, latexmk bails out after trying to build each *.pdf (including the main
% document) exactly once (which is not sufficient).
